NOTE:

These are the names given to the default print styles defined by Protext. However, these can be redefined to perform any print function. The default function, defines "on" and "off" printer control sequences. The "on" code initialises the function, and the "off" code disables the function. When the code is encountered, and it is not active, then it will be activated. If the code is encountered and it is active, then it will be deactivated.
These codes are used internally and are not saved out to a file
