# FroText
FroText is a Free ProText-like text editor for Linux.

When completed, FroText will (hopefully) be able to open and edit ProText, ProText 5 and ProText 6 files (as well as ASCII text files) and also create/convert into ProText 5 files and ASCII text files.  This is the goal, though it may take some time.

FroText uses the Quick and Dirty Input Library (libqdinp2) to read directly from the console (though other functions have been utilised in some places).

(Note that the copy of libqdinp2.a in the qdinp2 directory has been compiled for the Raspberry Pi 3 - you will need to download the library from [the github site] (https://github.com/dheadshot/libqdinp2) if you are using a different system).
